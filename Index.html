  <p> Hi I'm Tyler Bo a spohomore at Staten Island Tech. this website is being made for Whalen's period 7 class. I know that this will be a fun year and I think that it will be hard, but it will give me more opportunites to be creative. Over the summer I wen to SYEP and earned some money, but this year I'm planning to do more volurteering while also trying to earn money. I was excited that school started because I got to meet my friends again and I even have the opportunity to meet new people! </p>
